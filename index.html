<p>Welcome to our <b>Targeted Editing</b> series where today you can cheer on your favorite sports team, or make <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data supreme! (Both take about the same amount of time.)</p>

<p>Here in San Francisco, <a href="https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/420561633/">Super Bowl City</a> is attracting football fans from far and wide.  Firing up a barbecue grill in a stadium parking lot as part of a tailgate party is an American pastime.  Whether you are here in the Bay Area for the game, or you have plans to attend games at other stadiums this year, you are going to appreciate being able to find the parking areas on a map!  In North America, there are well over 3,000 stadiums in the OpenStreetMap data.  All of them have parking areas nearby, and nearly 47% of those nearby parking areas have parking aisles, too!

<p>Read on for some basic uses for parking areas and parking aisles, and where you can check to see if you can use your local knowlege to add some of these features where they are needed.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li><b>How are parking areas and parking aisles used?</b>
          <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Help with search.  Finding parking is often a big part of trip planning.</li>  
                <p></p> 
                <li>Help with routing.  While your final destination may be a point of interest, you are likely driving to that location's associated parking area.  When parking areas also have parking aisles connected to the road network, they can be used to route drivers in and out of parking areas.</li>  
                <p></p> 
                <li>Help with map display.  Parking lots are valuable features that drivers rely on, and parking aisles look beautiful on a map.  They provide helpful visual cues that are part of the wayfinding process.</li> 
                <p></p>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><b>We are missing some parking areas and parking aisles here!</b>

            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check out this table of some metro areas that have hosted Super Bowl games over the years:</li>
                <div id="stadium_table_div" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
                <p>Sort the columns by clicking the headers.  The <a href="https://github.com/IndyHurt/poi-stats/blob/gh-pages/queries/stadium_parking.sql#L2-L3">count of stadiums</a> includes all stadiums greater than 2,000 square meters so we can expand our evaluation beyond football, and the stadiums are checked for parking areas and parking aisles within 100 meters.</p>
                <p>Most of the stadiums in the Florida cities had parking areas nearby!  The numbers start to drop off a bit when we start checking for parking aisles.  It may seem like the OpenStreetMap data for parking areas and parking aisles near stadiums is lacking quite a bit in some important markets, but the search tolerance of 100 meters will be too small in some areas, and the lack of parking aisles in some parking areas is unexpected in parking garages.</p>   
                <p>The data comes from our <a href="https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/">metro extracts</a> and some of the extracts are very large.  For instance, the metro extract for Detroit extends north beyond Flint, and west beyond Ann Arbor!  The Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay metro extracts are equally enormous.  Bounding boxes can be used to trim down the analysis, but when so many stadiums are just outside of their namesake city limits, larger areas are a welcome option.</p> 
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><b>How you can help improve stadium parking:</b>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hover over one of the bright blue highlighted stadiums to bring up an info bubble with links to editing tools that can be used to add features.</li>

                </p> 
                 
                <p></p> 
                  <ul>See the wiki pages for <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dparking">amenity=parking</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:service%3Dparking_aisle">service=parking_aisle</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:oneway">oneway</a>.</ul>
                <p></p> 
                  <ul>oneway=yes can be added to parking aisles when the flow of traffic is restricted to one direction.  The direction will be the direction in which the parking aisle is digitized.</ul>
                <p></p>
                  <ul>For existing parking aisles, if the direction is incorrect, use the “reverse way” tool in iD to reverse the direction of the line to match the flow of oneway traffic.  This may also require adding additional nodes to the way to ensure that tags are applied to the appropriate segments.</ul>  
                <p></p>
                  <ul>Make sure parking aisles are connected to the road network in the appropriate locations.</ul>  
                <p></p>
                  <ul>Including your sources with the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:source">source</a> key is incredibly helpful.  This includes the imagery you used to trace features, and any authoritative websites as long as they allow their use for this purpose.</ul>
